## Overview

### Description

Allows Rubik’s Cube solvers to scan their cube, receive real-time AR overlays for algorithms, and time their solves—all in one app. 
Beginners can learn visually with guided instructions, and advanced solvers can track their history and personal bests.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Education / Sports
- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for AR scanning, real-time scrambling, and timing solves. The camera is used to recognize cube states,
  overlay solution steps, and provide visual feedback.
- **Story:** Helps solvers go from slow and frustrated to skilled and confident by giving them an all-in-one, visual-first tool. Makes learning
  algorithms less intimidating, improves practice through accurate timers and stats, and inspires speedcubers to beat their best times.
- **Market:** Appeals to beginner and intermediate cubers who want to improve, as well as serious speedcubers who track every solve.
  Rubik’s Cube has sold over 450M units globally, and the online cubing community is vibrant, active, and always seeking better tools.
- **Habit:** Users practice daily or weekly and rely on the app to generate scrambles, time sessions, and track performance.
- Solvers often aim for streaks, PBs (personal bests), or daily improvement goals—making this app a key part of their routine.
- **Scope:** V1 would include a scramble generator, manual timer, and solve history tracker. V2 would add AR cube state detection
  and visual overlays for guided learning. V3 would include session analytics and user profiles. V4 could expand to multiplayer scramble challenges or competitions.
