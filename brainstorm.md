## App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Rubik's Cube Scrambler + Timer + Solver
   - **Description**: Allows Rubik’s Cube solvers to scan their cube, receive real-time AR overlays for algorithms, and time their solves—all in one app. Beginners can learn visually with guided instructions, and advanced solvers can track their history and personal bests.
   - **Category:** Education / Sports
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for AR scanning, real-time scrambling, and timing solves. The camera is used to recognize cube states, overlay solution steps, and provide visual feedback.
   - **Story:** Helps solvers go from slow and frustrated to skilled and confident by giving them an all-in-one, visual-first tool. Makes learning algorithms less intimidating, improves practice through accurate timers and stats, and inspires speedcubers to beat their best times.
   - **Market:** Appeals to beginner and intermediate cubers who want to improve, as well as serious speedcubers who track every solve. Rubik’s Cube has sold over 450M units globally, and the online cubing community is vibrant, active, and always seeking better tools. 
   - **Habit:** Users practice daily or weekly and rely on the app to generate scrambles, time sessions, and track performance. Solvers often aim for streaks, PBs (personal bests), or daily improvement goals—making this app a key part of their routine.
   - **Scope:** V1 would include a scramble generator, manual timer, and solve history tracker. V2 would add AR cube state detection and visual overlays for guided learning. V3 would include session analytics and user profiles. V4 could expand to multiplayer scramble challenges or competitions.

2. Spending Tracker
   - **Description**: Allows users to quickly log daily expenses and see instant visual insights into their spending habits. Users can stay on top of their finances, build awareness of their money flow, and form healthier financial habits.
   - **Category:** Finance / Productivity
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for quick, on-the-go expense tracking. Users can log purchases at the moment they happen, review daily summaries, and receive reminders directly from their phones. Push notifications and lightweight visual tools help keep users engaged without overwhelming them.
   - **Story:** Helps people who want to be more intentional with their money but don’t have the time or energy for complex budgeting systems. Turns expense tracking into a simple, daily check-in that builds awareness and control without the pressure of perfection.
   - **Market:** Aimed at students, young professionals, and anyone seeking better day-to-day financial awareness. Appeals especially to people who find existing finance apps too bulky or intrusive. Monetization could include premium features like advanced insights, category breakdowns, or bank syncing.
   - **Habit:** Built for frequent, lightweight use—logging expenses daily or even after each transaction. Over time, users develop stronger financial habits through repetition, visibility, and small behavioral nudges. Monthly summaries or spending streaks can encourage ongoing engagement.
   - **Scope:** V1 would include manual expense entry, custom categories, and basic spending summaries. V2 could add push notifications, daily or weekly recap reports, and visual goal setting. V3 could introduce trends over time, recurring expense reminders, and deeper analytics. V4 might offer account syncing, shared household tracking, or predictive budgeting features.
